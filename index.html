    <h2>Welcome</h2>
    <div class="hero">
      <div class="intro">
        <p>Hello, I’m <strong>Liron Nyambu</strong>, a driven cybersecurity student and practitioner focused on defensive security, incident response, and digital forensics. I combine practical lab experience (TryHackMe / HackTheBox), forensic training, and real volunteer backend leadership work to build secure, reliable systems and investigate security incidents thoroughly.</p>
        <p>My goal while studying and volunteering is simple: deliver measurable security value, learn from experienced teams, and grow into an incident responder / forensics investigator who can handle real-world breaches end-to-end.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing a Diploma in Cybersecurity at Riara University (Year 2.1). I previously studied Cybersecurity &amp; Forensic Science at the University of Portsmouth (UK). My strengths are:</p>
    <ul class="skills-list">
      <li>Digital forensics: evidence collection, imaging, memory &amp; disk analysis, reporting and chain-of-custody practices.</li>
      <li>Defensive security: SOC monitoring, incident triage, vulnerability scanning, and log analysis.</li>
      <li>Backend engineering and APIs: I lead volunteer backend work and write clean, documented endpoints for production features.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="muted">I am motivated by real impact — I enjoy helping organisations improve security posture and supporting investigations that uncover the root cause of incidents.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="experience">
    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <div class="experience project">
      <h3>Backend Leader (Volunteer) — Lixnet</h3>
      <p>Volunteer backend lead responsible for the Tenant &amp; Payment modules.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Built backend logic for Tenant &amp; Payment modules using PHP and Python-compatible approaches.</li>
        <li>Designed and implemented RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations and payment workflows.</li>
        <li>Prepared unit tests, documentation, and deployment-ready configuration for the team.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="experience project">
      <h3>Hackathons &amp; Innovation</h3>
      <p>Active participant in multiple hackathons where I led development on AI-driven, practical solutions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Shamba Smart Helper</strong> — An AI-powered smart farm solution that automates crop and livestock monitoring and management using sensors, rule engines and automation. I worked on the system integration and the decision logic for automated actions (feeding, watering, alerts).</li>
        <li><strong>HeartSync</strong> — A relationship &amp; wellbeing platform with a post-recovery matching component. The app helps users connect with compatible personalities after recovery, includes a red-flag detection feature (users can record their known red flags and the system highlights potential mismatches), and integrates behaviour analysis to surface healthier matches.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="experience project">
      <h3>Forensics &amp; Defensive Cybersecurity Projects</h3>
      <p>I have completed multiple forensic investigations and defensive security labs including disk &amp; memory analysis, network packet analysis, log forensics, and simulated incident response exercises. I produce clear, actionable reports that non-technical stakeholders can follow.</p>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section id="projects">
    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>HeartSync – Relationship &amp; Recovery Platform</h3>
      <p>HeartSync helps users manage relationships and rebuild social connections after emotional recovery. Features include personality-based matching, red-flag detection in user input, profile heuristics to recommend compatible connections, and a privacy-minded architecture.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Shamba Smart Helper — AI-Powered Farming Assistant</h3>
      <p>Smart farm prototype that automates crop and livestock tasks using sensor input, scheduled automation and AI-driven recommendations. Built as a hackathon MVP with simulated sensors and rule-based automation for feeding, irrigation and alerts.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Internal Network Vulnerability Scan</h3>
      <p>Performed simulated vulnerability scans with Nmap and Nikto, identified and documented exploitable services and proposed remediation steps.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Phishing Awareness Simulation</h3>
      <p>Designed and executed user training simulations to improve phishing detection and reduce click-through rates in a small user group.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="project">
      <h3>Web App Security CTFs</h3>
      <p>Completed OWASP Top 10 focused CTFs on TryHackMe &amp; HackTheBox, demonstrating practical exploitation and mitigation strategies.</p>
      <p class="muted">I also do web development and can take on full-stack or backend roles as needed.</p>
    </div>
